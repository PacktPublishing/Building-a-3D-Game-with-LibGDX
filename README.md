This is the code repository for [Building a 3D Game with LibGDX](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/building-3d-game-libgdx?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785288418), published by Packt.

**Learn how to build an exciting 3D game with LibGDX from scratch**

## What is this book about?
LibGDX is a hugely popular open source, cross-platform, Java-based game development framework built for the demands of cross-platform game development. This book will teach readers how the LibGDX framework uses its 3D rendering API with the OpenGL wrapper, in combination with Bullet Physics, 3D Particles, and Shaders to develop and deploy a game application to different platforms

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn the potential of LibGDX in game development 
* Understand the LibGDX architecture and explore platform limitation and variations 
* Explore the various approaches for game development using LibGDX 
* Learn about the common mistakes and possible solutions of development 
* Discover the 3D workflow with Blender and how it works with LibGDX 
* Implement 3D models along with textures and animations into your games 
* Familiarize yourself with Scene2D and its potential to boost your gameâ€™s design

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
float FoV = 67;
PerspectiveCamera camera = new PerspectiveCamera(FoV,
Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());
```

## Get to Know the Author
**Sebastian Di Giuseppe**
started back in 2011 with Java game development and native Android development. With a huge passion, he spent a lot of time learning the different areas of game development, exploring programming areas, and creating prototypes of all kinds for several platforms. With a good plan for his improvement while having a full time job as an Android developer, he also spends a lot of time on the forum, java-gaming.org, learning and making contacts. He joined forces with a graphic designer and a musician to peruse more professional tasks and updates on their work that led him to meet a team of developers who called themselves Deeep Games. With them, he took a step up and also learned project and product management. With time, he joined and consulted other game development teams on management and processes. He now works as a full-time project and product manager and you can see him hang out on the Indie Game Developers' Facebook group posting updates on prototypes, ideas, or recruiting for future projects. You check out his LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebadigiuseppe/ or his Facebook profile at https://www.facebook.com/sebastian.digiuseppe.54.
